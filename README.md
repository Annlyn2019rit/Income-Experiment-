Problem Statement
        Poverty has long been a pervasive public policy challenge.
The number of households with children living in “extreme
poverty” — defined using the World Bank’s threshold of
individuals living on $2 or less of cash income per day —
has risen dramatically

Project Description
        Much of the existing literature on unconditional cash transfers in high-income countries focuses on
estimating effects on employment, but more recent studies suggest that this early preoccupation with
labor supply led us to overlook important effects of unconditional cash transfers on other outcomes.
The primary aim of Negative Income Tax (NIT) experiments conducted by the US government
in the 1970s was to examine the effect of a guaranteed income on labor force participation, but
supplemental analyses revealed positive effects on low birth weights, homeownership, health,
children’s academic achievement, and the number of adults pursuing continuing education.
